  <!-- Feature 1 -->
	<article class="grid-50 alpha">
		<h3 class="icon-view-mode feature">Responsive</h3>
		<p>Take a seat, build your desktop or mobile version, and watch your web site scale up or down instantly. A responsive grid built with the same heart as the 960 grid, but conceived using percentages rather than strict columns.</p>
	</article>

  <!-- Feature 2 -->
	<article class="grid-50 omega">
		<h3 class="icon-leaf feature">Semantic or Unsemantic</h3>
		<p>Since Centurion is built using Sass we've allowed developers to use the baked in grid system or the ability to create their own semantic grid. Whatever your code style Centurion is built to accommodate whatever is thrown at it.</p>
	</article>
	<div class="clear"></div>

  <!-- Feature 3 -->
  <article class="grid-50 alpha">
		<h3 class="icon-cogs feature">Integration</h3>
		<p>Most of frameworks only work with one Sass mixin library. However, Centurion has been redesigned to alongside <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a>, and many different libraries. If you have an issue with your mixin library, then <a href="https://github.com/jhough10/Centurion/issues">submit an issue for us</a>.</p>

  <!-- Feature 4 -->		
  <article class="grid-50 omega">
    <h3 class="icon-glasses feature">Easy to Learn</h3>
		<p>Finding it hard to learn a new framework? Don't worry anymore about a bloated code base with markup you have to override with important tags. Centurion features easy to read markup, classes and ID's that are semantic or unsemantic for your personal web tastes, and provides some basic <a href="get-started.html">documentation</a> to get you up to speed.</p>

  <!-- Feature 5 -->
  <article class="grid-50 alpha">
		<h3 class="icon-dashboard feature">Optimized</h3>
		<p>We've spent hours tweaking and fine-tuning the code in Sass to deliver a minimal footprint for web development. No more bloated code that is hard to understand and slows your browser down. If you use a Sass precompiler we've made it easy to remove code that you don't need.</p>
	</article>
		
  <!-- Feature 6 -->
  <article class="grid-50 omega">
    <h3 class="icon-wrench feature">Customizable</h3>
		<p>Comes out of the box with custom jQuery plugins for navigation (desktop and mobile), tables, tab boxes, alerts, and tooltips. Since Centurion was built using Sass you can even customize the core files to fit your needs and make your own custom version.</p>
